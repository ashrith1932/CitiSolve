# CitiSolve

CitiSolve is a city management and grievance redressal program designed to provide citizens with a structured platform to report, track, and resolve city-related issues. The project focuses on improving communication between the public and city authorities by offering a transparent and organized system for handling civic grievances.

The platform allows users to raise complaints related to urban infrastructure, public utilities, sanitation, transportation, safety, and other municipal services. Each grievance is recorded, categorized, and monitored to ensure accountability and timely resolution.

CitiSolve aims to simplify city management by centralizing complaints in one system, reducing manual processes, and enabling authorities to analyze recurring issues. By transforming individual complaints into actionable insights, the program supports better planning, efficient resource allocation, and improved quality of urban life.

The project emphasizes transparency, efficiency, and citizen participation, making city governance more responsive and data-driven.
